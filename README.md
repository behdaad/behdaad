### Hello, I'm Behdad!
An iOS Developer with more than 7 years of developing iOS apps.

Following 3+ years of technical leadership at a large-scale company with more than 40 million users, I am looking to transition back to being a software engineer. Although I enjoy leading and growing teams, I prefer being more hands-on on a day-to-day basis.
